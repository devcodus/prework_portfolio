                <p>My interest in music has been pretty life-long. My first major impact was listening to I’m Blue by Eiffel 65 on the radio. That moment foretold my future foray into music exploration.<br><br>

                    Slowly but surely, I started making a beeline to the source: Music Production itself. After some false starts and fits and go’s, I finally make a whole complete track in one sitting in major part thanks to my Music Mentor/Teacher: Enoch. 
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Looking forward, my latest chapter in my Music Saga intends to build myself up right: focusing on learning a handful of instruments while teaching myself music theory, as continue trying my hand at music production with DAW’s. The challenges I foresee include: being consistent, being consistent, being consistent, and learning to learn DAW’s without the benefit of a personal one-on-one tutor. I told myself that during my coding bootcamp busy-ness I would hold off on learning the DAW until I could hire another personal 1-on-1 tutor, however now I feel as though it would be better if I could teach myself intermediary skills that will make those future apprenticeship sessions much more productive and focused.<br><br>
                    
                    The aforementioned skills might include music theory and rudimentary instrument playing, as well as making the basic templates of my go-to music genres inside of the DAW…</p>

            <div id="my-code-story"><h5>my coding story</h5>
                <p>My interest in coding started in 2014 when I started to hear about a technology on twitter called Ethereum. It seemed to promise so much that would catapult society’s current ills, such as privacy incursions. It was a buzzing field with a lot of interest starting to be generated.<br><br>

                Thus my affinity for the tech field as a participator rather than a consumer, was born.<br><br>
                
                Eventually I heard about coding bootcamps and decided it would be a good idea to join one. In 2017 I joined a bootcamp called Coding Dojo. I did good enough, although not as stellar as I hoped. I attribute this to my still coming out of my social shell, thus my attention was disproportionately taken over by social cares, rather than investing 100% into my tech deep dive.<br><br>
                
                At the end of the bootcamp, I got a job with a friend that I ended up regretting. I feel as though if I got a job that I got on my own, rather than tagging along with my friend, I would have acquired a job that was a better fit.<br><br>
                
                This bosses and work had me hating my job. (I was basically enlisted to code my own replacement.) I had ascribed my hatred to my lack of collegiate computer engineer knowledge. Unfortunately, I ascribed too much importance to this hatred that wouldn’t go away, and took it as a sign that I should simply leave the field altogether.<br><br>
                
                Life, however, had different plans for me. Eventually, life brought me on a bee-line right back square to the coding field, this time to Coding Temple.<br><br>
                
                I have a deep feeling that this time it will be different.<br><br>
                
                This time, I’m not being distracted by social cares.
                <br><br>
                This time around, I am coming with a better sense of emotional intelligence and assimilation of handling any feelings of hatred.<br><br>
                
                This time, I’m committing myself to a deep dive in the web dev field.</p></div>
